# Repository overview

### The above projects are a compilation of my matlab programming experience from college, while pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Data Analysis

Most of the above work involved the application of machine learning and convex optimization problems to image analysis and processing in Matlab. 
- machine learning project - the main topic was processing images of coffee cups using gradient descent and lbfgs methods
- least squares - a project to implement the least squares method and apply it to some functions
